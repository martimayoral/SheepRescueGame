I've added different kind of sheeps, ones that are friendly that go slower and others that are angry and go faster.
In order to do so i had to create a new script with an enum of the sheep modes, and modify the sheep script to change speed and also color.
We can modify the color of the sheep from the inspector in a correct way.
